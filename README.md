# HollowKnight.GodhomeWinLossTracker

GodhomeWinLossTracker is a mod for the game Hollow Knight. It improves boss fight training experience by tracking win/loss against each boss in Hall of Gods and pantheons.

This mod is fully automated. It recognizes boss fights, records per-boss win/loss counts and saves them into `userX.modded.json` files (X = 1-4) in your `Save` folder. At each win/loss occurs, this mod shows a small notification at the bottom left corner of the game to indicate that the event has been recorded.
