# HollowKnight.GodhomeWinLossTracker

GodhomeWinLossTracker is a mod for the game Hollow Knight. It tries to improve boss fight training experience in Godhome by tracking win/loss against each boss in Hall of Gods and pantheons.

This mod is fully automated. It recognizes boss fights and detects win/loss events against each boss. As these events occur, this mod shows a small notification at the bottom left corner of the game to indicate that the event has been recorded.

This mod automatically records win/loss counts and saves them into `userX.modded.json` files (X = 1-4) in your save folder when you Save & Quite.
